## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-24

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Automatic code analysis enforcement** - flutter-specialist agent now ALWAYS runs `flutter analyze` and fixes all issues at the end of every task
  - Mandatory final step for all Dart/Flutter code work
  - Zero-tolerance policy for code quality issues
  - Automatically fixes errors, warnings, and lints before task completion
  - Runs `dart format .` for consistent code style
  - Tasks are not complete until `flutter analyze` shows zero issues
  - Detailed reporting of fixes applied
  - Integration with existing MCP code analysis tools

### Enhanced

- **flutter-specialist agent behavior**:
  - Proactive code quality enforcement (no user action needed)
  - Systematic fix prioritization (errors â†’ warnings â†’ lints)
  - Comprehensive fix patterns for all common issues
  - Iterative verification until zero issues remain
  - Clear success criteria (âœ… 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 lints)
  - Failure handling for issues requiring manual fixes

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive "CRITICAL: Always Finish with Code Analysis & Fixes" section
- Detailed workflow examples with expected outputs
- Integration guide between automatic behavior and `/analyze-and-fix` command
- Exception handling guidelines
- Zero-tolerance code quality policy documentation

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added

  - Supports common fix patterns:
    - Import management (add missing, remove unused)
    - Type annotations and null safety
    - Const constructor suggestions
    - Deprecated API replacements
    - Code formatting with `dart format`
    - Lint rule compliance
  - Iterative verification to ensure all issues resolved
