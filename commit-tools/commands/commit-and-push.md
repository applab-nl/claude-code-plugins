## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Your task

Based on the above changes:

1. Create a new branch if on main
2. Review, commit and push all changes with a single elaborate message explaining the changes. Nice if you use some emoticons but don't overdo it. Refrain from mentioning Claude as an author.
3. Push the branch to origin
4. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. You MUST do all of the above in a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
